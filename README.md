# Music App 🎶

A minimalist and fully functional music player application built using **React** and **Vite**. This project demonstrates key concepts in front-end development, including state management, and UI/UX design.

### Features ✨

- **Play/Pause/Skip**: Easily control music playback.
- **Seek Functionality**: A progress bar allows users to jump to any part of a song.
- **Dynamic Playlist**: A second view displays an infinite scrollable list of all available tracks. The currently playing song is automatically highlighted and moved to the top of the list for easy access.
- **Responsive UI**: The application features a dark, modern design with a spinning album art animation when a song is playing.

### Technologies Used 🛠️

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast, opinionated web dev build tool.
